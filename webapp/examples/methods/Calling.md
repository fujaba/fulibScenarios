# Scenario Calling.

// You can call methods using the 'call' keyword.
We call init.

// From here, we no longer describe the test method, but the init method.
// To specify this fact, we use sentences with the subject "init".
// 'Creates' provides an alternative to 'there' that allows defining a subject. 
Init creates a Company with name Foosoft and with revenue 0.
Init creates Employees with name John, Jack, Jill, and Jenna.

// You can still use 'has' inside method bodies.
Foosoft has employees John, Jack, Jill and Jenna.

// Return an object from a method using the 'answers' keyword.
Init answers with Foosoft.

// Now we are back in the scope of the test method.
// The result of the call is now available as a variable.
We expect that Foosoft has name "Foosoft".

// You can also call a method on an object.
We call generateRevenue on Foosoft.

// If you use a sentence that does not match the subject of the call, you will end up back in the test method scope.
We expect that Foosoft has revenue 0.
