# 1. Grammar

In this example, we want to add a sentence that takes the following form:

```text
We give <expr> a/an <class> with <attributes>. 
```

The first step is to add a new keyword \(`give`\). This is done in the file `ScenarioLexer.g4`, by adding a lexer rule:

```diff
 // --------------- Keywords ---------------

 A:        'a';
 AN:       'an';
 AND:      'and';
 // ...
 EXPECT:   'expect';
 FROM:     'from';
+GIVE:     'give';        // <--
 GREATER:  'greater';
 HAS:      'has';
 // ...
```

The next step is to update the grammar, by adding a new rule. Because we are adding a new type of sentence, we look under the `Sentences` section.

It is recommended to define your sentence as shown below, then test it using the ANTLR IntelliJ plugin \(Right Click on `mySentence` -&gt; Test rule `giveSentence`\). Once you are confident your rule is correct, you can enable it by adding an alternative to the `sentence` rule.

```diff
 // --------------- Sentences ---------------

 sentence: thereSentence
         | expectSentence
         | ...
+        | giveSentence // <-- enable
         ;

 // ...

+giveSentence: WE GIVE receiver=expr argument=constructor FULL_STOP; // <-- define

 // --------------- Clauses ---------------

 // ...
 constructor: typeClause withClauses?;
 typeClause: (A | AN) name CARD?
          | name CARDS;
 // ...
```

Now you are done modifying the grammar.

{% hint style="warning" %}
It is important to run the Gradle task `generateGrammarSource` now. It regenerates ANTLR sources and makes your changes to the grammar available in Java code.
