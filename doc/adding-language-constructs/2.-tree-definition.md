# 2. Tree Definition

Now that we have the grammar ready, we want to integrate our new construct into the compilation process. Later stages of the compiler do operate on the concrete syntax tree \(CST\) produced by ANTLR, but on a new tree-like model called the abstract syntax tree \(AST\). It consists of a number of classes that model our language constructs in a more higher-level fashion.

## Intro to GenTreeSrc

All AST classes inherit from the `Node` interface and implement the [visitor pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern). Because it is tedious to implement this pattern by hand, we use a tool called [GenTreeSrc](https://github.com/Clashsoft/GenTreeSrc) that generates the AST classes as well as the visitor classes. The tool uses a very simple syntax to define the AST classes:

```text
com.example.Node {
    expr.Expr {
        IntLiteral(value: int)
        StringLiteral(value: String)
    }
    stmt.Stmt {
        PrintStmt(expr: Expr)
    }
}
```

This definition generates the following classes:

1. interface `Node` in package `com.example`
2. interface `Expr` in package `com.example.expr`, which extends `Node`
3. interface `IntLiteral` in package `com.example.expr`, which extends `Expr` and has an attribute \(incl. getter and setter\) named `value` of type `int`.
4. interface `StringLiteral`, like `IntLiteral` but with `value` of type `String`.
5. interface `Stmt` in package `com.example.stmt`, which extends `Node`
6. interface `PrintStmt` in package `com.example.stmt`, which extends `Stmt` and has an attribute of type `Expr` named `expr`.

You can create instances of these interfaces using their static `of` method:

```java
PrintStmt.of(StringLiteral.of("test"))
```

In addition, all six classes have a nested class `Visitor<P, R>`. The inheritance graph of these visitor classes is the opposite of the AST classes:

```text
Node <- Expr <- IntLiteral
   ^       ^--- StringLiteral
    \-- Stmt <- PrintStmt

Node.Visitor -> Expr.Visitor -> IntLiteral.Visitor
           |               \--> StringLiteral.Visitor
            \-> Stmt.Visitor -> PrintStmt.Visitor
```

The net effect of this is that an `IntLiteral.Visitor` only needs to implement `visit(IntLiteral)`, while an `Expr.Visitor` needs to implement `visit(Expr)`, `visit(IntLiteral)` and `visit(StringLiteral)`, and Node.Visitor additionally `visit(Stmt)` and `visit(PrintStmt)`.

This will be important in step 3.

## Modifying the AST definition

Now that you know how the AST definitions work, you can go and add the definition for your new sentence type to the file `FulibScenarios.gts`:

```diff
 abstract org.fulib.scenarios.ast.Node {
     // ...
     abstract sentence.Sentence {
         ThereSentence(vars: [VarDecl]) // like CreatePhrase, but without an actor
         ExpectSentence(predicates: [ConditionalExpr]) // i.e. an assertion
         // ...
+        GiveSentence(receiver: Expr, argument: Expr)
     }
     // ...
 }
```

Note that in the grammar, we used the `constructor` rule for the `argument` \(because our sentence requires this form\). Despite `constructor` corresponding to `CreationExpr`, we use `Expr` here, to make our sentence more general. When someone wants to change our sentence to allow arbitrary expressions in the future, they only need to change the grammar and AST translator.

{% hint style="warning" %}
After modifying `FulibScenarios.gts`, run the Gradle task `gentreesrcJava` to generate the new classes.

**Note that this WILL break existing Java code** due to the addition of new methods in the `Node.Visitor` and `Sentence.Visitor` classes, which need to be implemented in existing implementations. See step 4 for information on how to resolve this problem.

You can reset the generated Java code by resetting your changes to `FulibScenarios.gts` and then running the Gradle tasks `clean` and `gentreesrcJava` \(in order\).
