# Editable Generated Sources

The source code generated by Fulib Scenarios is editable. This means when you add your own code and run the tool again, your code will not be removed or changed, but previously generated code will be updated.

This is implemented using 3-way merge. Lets take a look at an example.

Initially, we run the tool and generate a `Person` class with a `firstName` and `lastName` field \(omitting getters and setters for brevity\). The result looks like this:

{% code title="Person.java" %}
```java
class Person
{
	String firstName;
	String lastName;
}
```
{% endcode %}

Someone wants to add a `getFullName` method:

{% code title="Person\_edited.java" %}
```java
class Person
{
	String firstName;
	String lastName;

	String getFullName()
	{
		return firstName + " " + lastName;
	}
}
```
{% endcode %}

Now someone adds an `age` field to the definition. The new generated class would look like this:

{% code title="Person\_newgen.java" %}
```java
class Person
{
	String firstName;
	String lastName;

	int age;
}
```
{% endcode %}

However, we want to preserve the changes made by the user. To achieve that, we perform a three-way merge with `Person.java` as the base, `Person_edited.java` as _mine_ and `Person_newgen.java` as _yours_. The equivalent diff3 command looks like this:

```bash
$ diff3 Person_edited.java Person.java Person_newgen.java
```

Unfortunately, there is a merge conflict:

```text
class Person
{
	String firstName;
	String lastName;
<<<<<<< edited_a.java

	String getFullName()
	{
		return firstName + " " + lastName;
	}
||||||| gen_a.java
=======

	int age;
>>>>>>> gen_b.java
}
```
