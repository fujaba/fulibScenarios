# Expressions

Expressions are the language constructs that produce a value of sorts. Nearly every sentence has a place where an expression can appear.

```bnf
<expr> ::= <access> | <collection>
<namedExpr> ::= <simpleName> <primaryExpr>
              | <number> <name>
```

* [Primary](primary.md)
* [Access](access.md)
* [Collections \[WIP\]](collections.md)
* [Conditionals \[WIP\]](conditionals.md)
