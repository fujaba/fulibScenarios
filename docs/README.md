# Introduction

Welcome to the official documentation for Fulib Scenarios. Here you can find descriptions and detailed grammars for the language syntax, and explanations for the generated code.

We recommend first checking out the example scenarios on [fulib.org](https://www.fulib.org) to get an overview of the syntax. Note also, the documentation is not ordered by progressively increasing difficulty like the example scenarios; it's structure is based on the language features.

This documentation is still work in progress and may be incomplete. Unfinished chapters are marked with `[WIP]`.

* [Terminology](terminology.md)
* [Basics](basics.md)
* [Expressions](expressions/README.md)
* [Sentences \[WIP\]](sentences/README.md)
