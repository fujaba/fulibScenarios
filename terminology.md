# Terminology

## Object

An object is a concrete instance of a class.

## Class

A class defines a set of attributes, associations and methods.

## Method

A method is defined by an algorithm. It belongs to a class and can be **called** on an object, which is then called the **receiver** or **callee**.

## Attribute

An attribute contains information about an object. It can be **accessed** to retrieve its value for a concrete object.

## Association

An association is a special type of attribute that describes the relationship between objects.

## Actor

An actor is anything that can **do** things. This includes methods and the implicit test actor `we`.
