# Scenario init MineSweeper.

There is a MineSweeper with id ms. 

We call init on ms.

Init writes Hello and world into wordList.
Init creates Field cards with id f1 to f9 
and with number 1 to 9
and with parent ms.

Init writes 42 into result. 
Init writes f1 to f2 and f7 to f8 and f4 into neighbors of f2 to f3 and f8 to f9 and f5.
Init writes 10 to 20 into myNumberList.

<!--We expect that ms has fields f1 to f9.-->
