# Introduction

Welcome to the official documentation for Fulib Scenarios. Here you can find descriptions and detailed grammars for the language syntax, and explanations for the generated code.

This documentation is still work in progress and may be incomplete. We recommend first checking out the example scenarios on [fulib.org](https://www.fulib.org) to get an overview of the syntax.
